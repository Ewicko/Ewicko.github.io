## About this site

This site is documenting my journey as I learn about Quantum Mechanics. The primary goal of this site is to learn about Quantum Mechanics. The secondary goal of this site is to make a repository of knowledge for teams I work with about my work.\\
The idea for this site came from the Feynman method. Since I am not in grad school, I don't have to teach. This is serving as my replacement for teaching.\\
I am primarily reading *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* (Nielsen, et al.) and *Quantum Computing Since Democritus*\\
This is a sort of OP notebook. If it is helpful for you, thats great! Consider sharing with someone who you think would find it interesting.\\
